# Box size, dimension, and redshift of input density field

BoxSize		8e3 # comoving box size in Mpc/h
N		512 # dimension of the grid
zInit		0  # redshift of the initial density contrast field

# This is the input file location.
# The file should be the matter density contrast, delta = (rho-<rho>)/<rho>
# where rho is the density in the cell and <rho> is the mean density.
# The format is 4 byte binary float, so the size of InputFile should be
# 4*N^3 bytes. The field is the density contrast at a redshift zInit. It should
# be linear, i.e. delta << 1 everywhere.

DeltaFile	./ICs/delta

# Reionization algorithm parameters, probably don't need to change these

Rmin		0.5 # minimum scale to smooth over in units of a cell size
		    # 0.5 should be a good value don't need to change
Nscales		4  # number of scales to smooth over
		    # usually 32 is sufficient don't need to change
